#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
   /* printf function displays the content that is
    * passed between the double quotes.
    */
   printf("Hello World");
   return 0;
}

Here is the explanation for each tag used there in it:

 #include <stdio.h> – This statement tells compiler to include this stdio.h file in the program. This is a standard input output file that contains the definitions of common input output functions such as scanf() and printf(). In the above program we are using printf() function.

2. int main() – Here main() is the function name and int is the return type of this function. Every C program must have this function because the execution of program begins with the main() function. The 0 return value of this function represents successful execution of program while the return value 1 represents the unsuccessful execution of program. This is the reason we have return 0; statement at the end of this main function.

3. printf("Hello World"); – This function displays the content within double quotes as it is on the screen.

4. return 0; – As mentioned above, the value 0 means successful execution of main() function.
